There are not so many codes in this chapter. But in this chapter, it introduces the basic principle of Markov chain.

Some properties in this chapter:
1. Time-homogeneous $P(X_n = j | X_{n-1} = i) = P(X_1 = j | X_0 = i)$
2. stochastic matrix
3. markov property $P(X_n = j | X_1 = s_1 , X_2 = s_2 , ... , X_{n-1} = s_{n-1}) = P(X_n = j | X_{n-1} = s_{n-1})$
4. n-step transition matrix
5. Chapmanâ€“Kolmogorov Relationship
6. Distribution of $X_n$
7. Joint Distribution of $X_n$
8. Long term behavior
