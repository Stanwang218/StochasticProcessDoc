# StochasticProcessDoc
This repo is based on the book <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118740712">Introduction to Stochastic Processes with R</a>. This is an after-class review for course <a href = "http://www.math.chalmers.se/Stat/Grundutb/CTH/mve550/1819/">MVE550: Stochastic Process and Bayesian Inference</a> in Chalmers University of Technology. 


This repo is divided into two parts. 

The frist part is about stochastic process and there are eight chapters in total.
